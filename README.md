# SQL code for an exercise on Normal Forms, ERM and SQL 

These SQL codes are a possible solution for an exercise on Normal Forms, ERM, and SQL. The code has been written with MySQL as target. Nonetheless it should basically run on any SQL-capable database as no special commands have been used. 

## Authorship
All SQL files have been written for my project _Der TabellenDoktor_ (www.tabellendoktor.de). Please feel free to use the SQL examples but keep the link to the website included. Thank you!

## Words of precaution
**&tldr; Think before you run something. And creating backups is never wrong**

* Running any of the code from this repo/collection of code is the sole responsibility of you as the user
* Examples are just that: examples
* If you do not understand it, do not run it. Especially not on production environments
* Code might behave differently on your platform/in your environment than intended
